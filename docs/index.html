            My name is Carla Serena Bruce, I am Togolese and French, and I am 23 years old! Let me tell you more about me.
            I am the fifth of seven children; I have four brothers and two sisters. I was born in France and then moved to
            Togo with my parents where I l did all my education from primary school to high school in a French school there. 
            I moved out in 2017 when I had my high school diploma. I came to Bordeaux where I started going to Kedge Business School
            At first, it wasn’t easy to be far from my family, but I signed in the basketball team, so I wasn’t that alone anymore.
            At Kedge, I chose European Business Program, so I got to travel the world for internships
            and exchanges. It was a really good experience but covid came and we had to switch
            everything to online mode. During this lockdown period I went back to Togo to stay with my
            family.
            During this period, I worked on myself and the different projects that I had on standby, I’ve
            always wanted to undertake and open my own business, which I did during this period. I
            opened my wig brand and show room in Togo.
            Unfortunately, classes started back in physical, so I had to come back to France, I try to work
            on everything from distance, it is not the easiest thing, but I have a good team with me
            which facilitate everything.
            I am currently doing an MSc in International Business specialized in doing business in Africa,
            Asia and Middle East.
